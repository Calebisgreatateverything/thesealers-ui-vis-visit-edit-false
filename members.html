    <h1>the sealers members</h1>
    <h2>Caleb</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Birthday 04/17/12<br><br>The creator of this website, and one of the latest to join the group, Caleb
    is the 6th member of the sealers groupchat. He was also the one who came up with the idea for the sealers, but
    the seal idea goes to Clodia. This is one of the youngest but the best members of the sealers groupchat.</p>
    <hr id="hr2">
    <h2>Celine</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Birthday 10/06/11<br><br>Celine, the oldest members of the sealers groupchat. Celine is mostly known
    for not chatting but lurking in on chats. She is also really good at Tennis, and any other sport that is not
    Ping Pong (I would crush her)</p>
    <hr id="hr2">
    <h2>Covina</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Birthday 10/06/11<br><br>One of the quietest, but not the most quiet is Covina. She is one of the most likely
    to join a call if she is free and she can talk for hours until she has to go to Sephora or decorate her Christmas tree
    (Its not like I put up mine early too) She always saves and spends her money on random things like clothes (I would spend
    it on robux :8)</p>
    <hr id="hr2">
    <h2>Clodia</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Birthday 10/06/11<br><br>Most responsive of the triplets, Clodia is certin to be cronically online enough
    to give you a responce within 4-6 hours time. Clodia is in my opinion the most gossipy in the groupchat with telling
    all the rumors.</p>
    <hr id="hr2">
    <h2>Myah</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Birthday 03/25/12<br><br>Being barley older then me, Myah is next on the list of members in the sealers groupchat.
    Myah is byfar the biggest texter in the sealers. She starts and ends the conversation as she is basically always available in
    moments notice. She also is the one that asks to call the most. Her most send text is "Pull up!"</p>
    <hr id="hr2">
    <h2>Josie</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Birthday 07/08/12<br><br>Being the youngest in the group, is Josie. Josie is basically always putting
    emojis on text messages, such as üî™, or ‚ö∞Ô∏è(Who let her get IOS 18?) She is also the only Blonde in the group as everyone else
    is Brunette. This makes sense. Her and Myah were the first best friends (I think) and they hang out at each others
    houses all the time. She is also always available.</p>
